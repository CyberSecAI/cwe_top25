Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n", "ObservedExamples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2022-29964", "Description": "Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29964"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2021-37555", "Description": "Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37555"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2021-35033", "Description": "Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-35033"}], "MappingNotes": {"Usage": "Allowed"}, "1003_view": "No", "Top25Examples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2022-26138", "Description": "The Atlassian Questions For Confluence app for Confluence Server and Data Center creates a Confluence user account in the confluence-users group with the username disabledsystemuser and a hardcoded password.

Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting."}]}

This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n", "AlternateTerms": [{"Term": "Authorization", "Description": "The terms \"access control\" and \"authorization\" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions.

In order that they may verify this shared secret without sending it plainly over the wire, they utilize a Diffie-Hellman-style scheme in which they each pick a value, then request the hash of that value as keyed by the shared secret. In a reflection attack, the attacker claims to be a valid user and requests the hash of a random value from the server. When the server returns this value and requests its own value to be hashed, the attacker opens another connection to the server. This time, the hash requested by the attacker is the value which the server requested in the first connection. When the server returns this hashed value, it is used in the first connection, authenticating the attacker successfully as the impersonated valid user.\n", "ObservedExamples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2005-3435", "Description": "product authentication succeeds if user-provided MD5 hash matches the hash in its database; this can be subjected to replay attacks.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-3435"}], "MappingNotes": {"Usage": "Allowed"}, "1003_view": "No"}

When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself.

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n", "ObservedExamples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2022-30273", "Description": "SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30273"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2022-30320", "Description": "Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30320"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2008-3775", "Description": "Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3775"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2007-4150", "Description": "product only uses \"XOR\" to obfuscate sensitive data", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4150"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2007-5460", "Description": "product only uses \"XOR\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5460"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2005-4860", "Description": "Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4860"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2002-2058", "Description": "Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-2058"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2008-3188", "Description": "Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3188"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2005-2946", "Description": "Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2946"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2007-6013", "Description": "Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-6013"}], "MappingNotes": {"Usage": "Allowed-with-Review"}, "1003_view": "Yes", "Top25Examples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2021-31562", "Description": "The SSL/TLS configuration of Fresenius Kabi Agilia Link + version 3.0 has serious deficiencies that may allow an attacker to compromise SSL/TLS sessions in different ways.

This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol.

Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data.

The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used.

If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version.

For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a \"rainbow table\" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.\n", "ObservedExamples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2022-30320", "Description": "Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30320"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2005-4900", "Description": "SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4900"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2020-25685", "Description": "DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-25685"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2012-6707", "Description": "blogging product uses MD5-based algorithm for passwords.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-6707"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2019-14855", "Description": "forging of certificate signatures using SHA-1 collisions.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-14855"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2017-15999", "Description": "mobile app for backup sends SHA-1 hash of password in cleartext.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15999"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2006-4068", "Description": "Hard-coded hashed values for username and password contained in client-side script, allowing brute-force offline attacks.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4068"}], "MappingNotes": {"Usage": "Allowed"}, "1003_view": "No", "Top25Examples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2022-3433", "Description": "The aeson library is not safe to use to consume untrusted JSON input.
