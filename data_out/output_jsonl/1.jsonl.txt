In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server.

An attacker could exploit this to access secrets. Several virtualization-based mitigations have been introduced to thwart DMA attacks. These are usually configured/setup during boot time.

The JTAG interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. Since almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface, device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. This mechanism is implemented in addition to on-chip protections that are already present.\n\n\nIf authorization, authentication, or some other form of access control is not implemented or not implemented correctly, a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms through the debug interface.\n\n\nSometimes, designers choose not to expose the debug pins on the motherboard. Instead, they choose to hide these pins in the intermediate layers of the board. This is primarily done to work around the lack of debug authorization inside the chip. In such a scenario (without debug authorization), when the debug interface is exposed, chip internals are accessible to an attacker.\n", "ObservedExamples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2019-18827", "Description": "chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-18827"}], "MappingNotes": {"Usage": "Allowed"}, "1003_view": "No", "Top25Examples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2022-45552", "Description": "An Insecure Permissions vulnerability in Shenzhen Zhiboton Electronics ZBT WE1626 Router v 21.06.18 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via SPI bus interface connected to pinout of the NAND flash memory."}]}

The most prominent is the stored return address, the memory address at which execution should continue once the current function is finished executing. The attacker can overwrite this value with some memory address to which the attacker also has write access, into which they place arbitrary code to be run with the full privileges of the vulnerable program. Alternately, the attacker can supply the address of an important call, for instance the POSIX system() call, leaving arguments to the call on the stack. This is often called a return into libc exploit, since the attacker generally forces the program to jump at return time into an interesting routine in the C standard library (libc). Other important data commonly on the stack include the stack pointer and frame pointer, two values that indicate offsets for computing memory addresses. Modifying those values can often be leveraged into a \"write-what-where\" condition."], "AlternateTerms": [{"Term": "Stack Overflow", "Description": "\"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call.

{"ID": "1240", "Name": "Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation", "Abstraction": "Base", "Description": "To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.", "ExtendedDescription": "\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n", "ObservedExamples": [{"Reference": "CVE-2020-4778", "Description": "software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-4778"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2005-2946", "Description": "Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2946"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2019-3907", "Description": "identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-3907"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2021-34687", "Description": "personal key is transmitted over the network using a substitution cipher", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34687"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2020-14254", "Description": "product does not disable TLS-RSA cipher suites, allowing decryption of traffic if TLS 2.0 and secure ciphers are not enabled.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-14254"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2019-1543", "Description": "SSL/TLS library generates 16-byte nonces but reduces them to 12 byte nonces for the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher, converting them in a way that violates the cipher's requirements for unique nonces.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1543"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2017-9267", "Description": "LDAP interface allows use of weak ciphers", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9267"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2017-7971", "Description": "SCADA product allows \"use of outdated cipher suites\"", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7971"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2020-6616", "Description": "Chip implementing Bluetooth uses a low-entropy PRNG instead of a hardware RNG, allowing spoofing.", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6616"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2019-1715", "Description": "security product has insufficient entropy in the DRBG, allowing collisions and private key discovery", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1715"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2014-4192", "Description": "Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in RSA toolkit does not correctly handle certain byte requests, simplifying plaintext recovery", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4192"}, {"Reference": "CVE-2007-6755", "Description": "Recommendation for Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm contains point Q constants that could simplify decryption", "Link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-6755"}], "MappingNotes": {"Usage": "Allowed"}, "1003_view": "No"}

Many web UI or REST APIs use the underlying operating system for authentication; the system's logic may also track an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information in the UI or REST API's interface system and the underlying operating system's user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added account.\n\n\nThis discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:\n\n\n  - A rogue admin could insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.\n\n  - An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account is either partially created or not at all.\n\n  - An attacker could create an admin account which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account, delete logs and delete the first created admin account.\n\nMany of these attacker scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS, command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems.
